I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD), where I am working with <a href="https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/song/xiaopeng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Xiaopeng Song</a> and <a href="https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/hansen/matthew-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Matthew Hansen</a> at the <a href="https://glad.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD)</a> team.

My research interests focus on monitoring agricultural sustainability through sample-based and satellite-based approaches, including operational large-scale satellite data processing systems, high-resolution crop type mapping, crop extent and phenology tracking, and crop yield forecasting. Currently, I am working on operational high-resolution crop type mapping by combining machine learning, field surveys, and various satellite data, including Sentinel-2, Landsat, MODIS, and the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS).

Before joining UMD in 2022, I studied for two years in the Geosciences Doctoral program at <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/geosciences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Tech University</a>. Prior to my Ph.D. journeys abroad, I worked for three years as a senior software engineer at <a href="https://ir.netease.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase, Inc.</a> in China. I obtained my M.S. in Cartography and Geography Information System in 2017, from the <a href="http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing</a>, Wuhan University, where I worked with <a href="http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/Chsite/english.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Xiaoling Chen</a> on environmental remote sensing, especially in water environments. I received my B.S. in Geographic Information System in 2014 from the <a href="https://sres.whu.edu.cn/English/About/Overview.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Resource and Environmental Sciences (SRES)</a>, Wuhan University.
