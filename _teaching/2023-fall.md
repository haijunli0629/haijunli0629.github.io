The course provides an introduction to application programing interface (API) functions and image processing techniques for efficient processing of satellite images. The main programing language of the course is Python. The course uses a Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which provides a unified way of manipulating images incorporating geospatial information. For image processing, the course uses Python-based libraries such as scikit-image.
